	<p> LB doesn't know much about his birthparents, as far as he knows, he was adopted by these two women when he was 3 and is the middle child of two brothers. He was always very reserved and shy growing up while both of his brother were pretty social and extroverted. He was in band from Primary School to High school since music is a huge passion for him. He grew up in a small town right at the edge of Clown Central where everyone knew everyone. LB didn't have many friends growing up, he only had two friends and they did everything together from the age 5 to 17. By the time LB was a senior in high school, both of his friends had moved away. He felt very alone so to cope with it, he applied for an internship in CCU Headquarters. He spend his time stacking boxes and sorting papers until one day when The Boss was in the office and was telling the employees how streesed they were. LB overheard the conversation and suggested that The Boss gets an assigntent to help with the issue so The Boss offered LB a job on the spot. </p>
