	 <h1> LB's Living Space</h1>
	 <p> LB is a pretty clean person. His home occasionally gets messy when he is super busy but for the most part he tries to keep it clean. He lives in a decent sized condo in the middle of Clown Central. He lives very close to the ground becuase heights make him nervous. He has his pet peeves about livng in one of the busiest parts of Clown Central but he also thinks that the view from his condo is beautiful and living in such a busy area keeps him from being bored. He has a little black cat named Pancake that he basically worships. She has her own room and he loves to spend way to much money on her.</p>
