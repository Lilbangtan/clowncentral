	<h1> LB's personality and intrests</h1>
	<p> I would describe LB as an introvert. He comes off very shy and anxious most of the time but still very friendly.He spends his free time tending to his pet cat pancake and making music. LB says that if he wasn't working for The Boss he would of probaly been a musician. LB can play the drums, bass, piano, violin, trumpet and saxaphone. Growing up, his family was very music and always had instruments laying around the house. Music is something that maakes LB feel very connected to his family, it is something that makes him feel grounded after a long day of jumping from universe to universe.</p>

	<h2> Fun Fact! </h2>
	<p> "LB the Clownboy" is just a nickname people from the other universes use. Since in Clown Central, the norm is to where clown makeup, but when people from other Universes see LB or visit Clown Central, they see it as odd or intresting.</p>
