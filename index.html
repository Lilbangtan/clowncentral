	  	<p> His day to day life is pretty simple. He wakes up at 9 every morning and gets a strawberry cream chesse bagel and heads to the office at 10. Some days the office is hectic as it is where people are able to go through the universes, so there are always people in the office going from universe to universe. LB is like that right hand man of the Boss. He is almost always in the office and updates the Boss on whatever goes on.</p>
